# Assignment 1 - Pass the Pigs

DESCRIPTION
This program runs a simple cyclic game based on asking the user for 2 inputs, asking for players between 2-10 as wellas a seed that provides a recreatable pattern of numbers. These inputs will be used to determine the retraints associated with the game. The program will determine a winner based on when the player will randomly roll to pig and land in a specified position to gain points until landing on side which, ends the player's turn and the next player's turn begins. Eventually the winner will be the person that reaches 100 points first and the game will end.

## Building

Files

names.h

Header file that is included in the pig.c implementation to provided names of players in an array

pig.c

This contains the implementation of the game.

Makefile

This file will be provided in the course resource repository. It is a file that directs program compi-lation, building the programpigfrompig.c.

README.md

It describe how to use your program.	

DESIGN.pdf

This design document must describe your design anddesign  process  for  your  program  with  enough  detail  such  that  a  sufficiently  knowledgeable  programmerwould be able to replicate your implementation.

##RUNNING

INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be run in the Ubuntu Virtual Box with PuTTY and in order to run program you must provide two inputs, one for the number of players and two for seed.
